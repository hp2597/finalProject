                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Incentives Matter:</strong> People respond to incentives in predictable ways, often producing unintended consequences when incentives are ignored.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trade-offs Are Universal:</strong> There are no solutions, only trade-offs. Every economic decision involves costs and benefits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge Is Dispersed:</strong> No single person or committee can possess all the knowledge needed for effective central planning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prices Convey Information:</strong> Market prices communicate crucial information about scarcity, demand, and value across society.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong."</p>

                        <li><strong>Push–Pull Factors:</strong> People migrate in response to conditions at home (push) and opportunities abroad (pull).</li>
                        <li><strong>Labor Market Effects:</strong> Immigration changes the supply of labor, affecting wages, employment, and economic growth over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Policy Incentives:</strong> Legal rules, enforcement, and benefits shape migrant decisions more than rhetoric does.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assimilation & Institutions:</strong> Integration outcomes depend on culture, local institutions, and expectations on both sides.</li>

                        <p>"Any serious discussion of immigration has to distinguish between what sounds compassionate and what actually produces sustainable, humane outcomes."</p>

                    <blockquote>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Incentives in Politics:</strong> Politicians respond to voters, interest groups, and media pressures—not abstract ideals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Choice:</strong> Government actors are people with their own incentives and constraints, not benevolent abstractions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bureaucratic Constraints:</strong> Agencies rarely face clear feedback or consequences when policies fail.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decentralization & Federalism:</strong> Distributing power allows for experimentation, local knowledge, and competition between jurisdictions.</li>

                        <p>"People who pride themselves on their 'complexity' and deride others for being 'simplistic' should realize that the truth is often not very complicated. What gets complex is evading the truth."</p>
